\section{2D level plot (heatmap) with given data}
Heatmap is available for ``stats" package\autocite{Rcore}, which requires a matrix input and without a intrinsic colour reference (forum \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9314658/colorbar-from-custom-colorramppalette}{thread} on creating a colour reference).  ``ggplot2" package\autocite{ggplot} also provide a \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43772017/continuous-gradient-color-fixed-scale-heatmap-ggplot2}{solution} but the code is long.  For users not used to the ``ggplot2" package, learning curve might also be steep.  Hence, the author recommends the ``lattice" package\autocite{lattice}, which provides a simple yet on-point method for plotting a dependent variable against two independent variables.

One thing to note is ``missing data", which always being displayed as "white" in the levelplots (Fig.).
